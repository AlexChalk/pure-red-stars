# Pure-Red-Stars

An unholy merging of [Fishy](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/themes/fishy.zsh-theme), [Purity](https://github.com/therealklanni/purity), and [CJT](https://github.com/christoomey/dotfiles/blob/77fb4084bd3f207aace80aa93a49769a6a298ddb/zsh/cjt.zsh-theme).

## Features

* Fish-like display of the current working directory.
* Purity-like color scheme and unicode symbols.
* Chris Toomey's git info configuration: red notification when dirty, short commit hash, and `HEAD` notification when in detached head state.

Please note that, unlike Purity, this theme doesn't include checks for unpulled/unpushed commits or an application runtime timer.
